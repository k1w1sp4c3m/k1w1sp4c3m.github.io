A ressource to share my tinkering with anything cybersecurity and technology in general aimed at doing good.

I am 'k1w1sp4c3m' from the ["Si Vis Pacem, Para Bellum"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Si_vis_pacem,_para_bellum) latin adage, meaning "If you want peace, prepare for war".

I am actively learning about how wrongdoers do damage in order to protect as many as I can from them.
