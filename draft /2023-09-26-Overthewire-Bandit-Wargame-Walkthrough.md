## Bandit wargame walkthrough

###Context
Our first « wargame » where we are trying to find a password in each level to reach the next one.

The link to access the instructions is: [Bandit Homepage](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/)

You are advised to use the instructions to beat the level by yourself before checking the walkthroughs. If blocked on a level, do a bit of research with ~~Google~~ your search engine of choice before looking at our solution. Some levels are tricky and you will learn a great deal even by looking at the answer.
