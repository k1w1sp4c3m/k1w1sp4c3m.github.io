## Creating k1w1sp4c3m

### Foreword & Origin
I am creating this ressource to share my tinkering with anything cybersecurity and technology in general aimed at doing good.

I shall be known as 'k1w1sp4c3m' from the ["Si Vis Pacem, Para Bellum"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Si_vis_pacem,_para_bellum) latin adage, meaning "If you want peace, prepare for war".

I will learn about how wrongdoers perform some actions in order to protect as many as I can from them.

### k1w1sp4c3m
I am a tech enthousiast, working in IT consulting and aiming at becoming a refence in Technology and Cybersecurity.

I am entirely self taught on the matter, and I do not pretend that I hold the absolute truth, although I am convinced of what I share here.

I enjoy other things than tech: building legos, playing games, piano, running, and tinkering in real life (lockpicking, ...).

### GMAIL
In order to create the k1w1sp4c3m accounts we first create a Gmail account, for simplicity's sake and because we do not mind Google's invasive nature in this activity that will be public anyway.

Not much to mention here, it is pretty straighforward and most of us have already done this at least once.

One tidbit is that passwords in Gmail are limited to 100 characters, which is lower than our standards using our trusty free password manager ([Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) - simply recommended, no affiliation).

### Github
k1w1sp4c3m projects are hosted on Github, because what isn't? Including this blog which is a Github Page.

Github reduces password length to 72, how insecure! (Though it would still take billions of years with current (2023) hardware).

Then we follow the step of [this article](https://chadbaldwin.net/2021/03/14/how-to-build-a-sql-blog.html) to make this page appear as my first article.

We have this nice result, so that's all for today, Thank you for reading and have a great & safe day!


### Footnotes
I will write an article about Bitwarden and password managers in general.
