### Provided Instructions
> The password for the next level is stored in a file somewhere under the inhere directory and has all of the following properties:

### Detailed Walkthrough
Let's jump right in our terminal:
```bash
k1w1sp4c3m@p4r48377um:~$ ssh bandit6@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
>{r3d4ct3d_b4nd1t6_p455w0rd}<
bandit6@bandit:~$
```

We use our trusty SSH command with username to â€˜bandit5â€™, and provide the password found in the [previous level](../../../2023/09/28/Overthewire-Bandit-Level-5-to-6-Walkthrough.html), which you can get by playing it yourself!

Coming sooooon

```bash
aaa
```

aaaa
```bash
bandit5@bandit:~$ cat inhere/maybehere07/.file2
>{r3d4ct3d_b4nd1t6_p455w0rd}<
```


Congratulations to ourselves for beating the sixth level! One more step towards our destination!
