##Overthewire Wargames Introduction

### Concept
"Wargames", isn't that scary? No worries though, no one will get hurt and the only risk here is to learn something!

A **[Wargame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wargame_(hacking))** is a staged challenge, online or live, where competitor must circumvent some security to gain access to a system that they should not be able to access.
The "proof" that they have managed to do it is called a **Flag** and is usually a complex chain of characters that cannot be guessed.

Overthewire is a collection of such games that can be accessed at anytime by anyone with a computer and for free.

In Overthewire the objective of each level of a given Wargame is to find the password in order to access the next level.
